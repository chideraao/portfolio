            <p>Hi there, I&apos;m Dera! üëãüèΩ </p>
            <p>
              I am a Software Developer specializing in frontend technologies,
              and passionate about building accessible and interactive web
              experiences and visualizations.

            <h3>Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              My goal as a Frontend Developer is to bring ideas to life by
              developing unique user-facing features that enhance the overall
              user experience. I possess outstanding knowledge of the latest
              industry standards, allowing me to deliver fast and reliable
              applications while optimizing performance.

            <h3>Others</h3>
            <p>
              I am constantly learning and working to become a better version of
              myself. Adept at technical writing, I have authored multiple
              articles on frontend practices and data visualization; and
              recently released a Firebase course on Educative, Inc. I love
              teaching concepts and writing API documentation, tutorials, and
              how-to guides.
